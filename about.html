<p>JOS is an operating system written entirely in FreeBASIC, which will soon be compiled to machine code.<br/>
This operating system is designed to be fast and efficient with loading programs, and writing them.<br/>
Programs will be written in BASIC, which is an easy language to pick up.<br/>
As for efficiency:<br/>
All main programs shipped with JOS are built into the Kernel itself, for fast loading,<br/>
and the Kernel is lightweight, so it won't take up much ram, leaving plenty for loading programs.
