		Installing JOS is easy! You don't even need to wipe your hard drive! You can just download the <a href="https://github.com/J-and-J-Programming-Industries/JOSPre-Release/blob/master/releases/JOS.exe?raw=true">Windows</a> version here as an executable, or the <a href="https://github.com/J-and-J-Programming-Industries/JOSPre-Release/blob/master/releases/JOS?raw=true">Linux</a> version at the links, then running them!<br/>
		After you have downloaded them, double click on the .exe file on Windows, or type ./JOS in the terminal on Linux.<br/>
		It is a command line based program, so your desktop will continue to run in the background.<br/>
		All programs you have already will still work, as it does not replace your native OS.<br/>
		Soon, a downloadable OS .iso will be available that will contain JOS and some programs with it, alongside a Arch Linux backbone for running programs not compatible with JOS.
